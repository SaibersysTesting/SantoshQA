Data driving from Excel for feeding data:
-----------------------------------------
1) We use this when we are working with data driven framework
2) For that we need to download POI API jars.
3) These jars are useful to get the values fro excel or to set the values backt to excel
4) Apache POI -download release artifacts.(to download jars)
5) (https://poi.apache.org/download.html)

    Then to connect the data to eclipse,we have give fileinputstream to identfy the path of excel sheet
     i.e FileinputStream fis -- new fileinputStream();
