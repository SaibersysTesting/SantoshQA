Page object model(POM):
--------------------
We can automate both web applications and mobile applications using this Page object pattern(POM).

EXample:

For Home page:
-------------
->Create a java class(AmazonHomepage).
->Define all the objects of homepage in this class.

Then suppose for login page create another java class and define objects in that class
->Java class (Loginpage)
-> define objects

In this way for thousands of pages we can call just object of that class and write the test cases.
