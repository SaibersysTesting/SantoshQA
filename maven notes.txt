Jenkins:
---------
1) jenkins is basically a integration tool.You can schedule your test cases from jenkins.
2) With help of jenkins we can check out the code from the central repositories like SVN,Github.
   And we can have the option to mail the reports.
3) We will use build management tool "Maven" or "Ant"

commands:
---------
java-jar jenkins.war -httpport-8080 (enter this command in command prompt)

And enter localhost:8080 then jenkins  will start

Maven:
-----
1) Maven itself designs a project structure for us so that we don't need to separate folders or
   packages.It will give us nice hierarchy which will separate object reposiroties and testcases
2) It has in built project to develop framework dsign.
3) We don't need to import selenium jars ,if we give 4 lines of dependency code into maven
   POM.xml file then maven will do everything .

Creating Maven project:
----------------------
commands:

mvn archetype:generate

Groupid
Artifact id:
 then go on pressing enter
 then enter y

To connect maven and eclipse we should give a command:

mvn eclipse:eclipse

compile
mvn compile - checks the syntax errors in the code 
mvn test - download the jars which are required   Reference pom.xml

profiles
mvn test-PSmokeTesting(smoke testing is id)
